# About Yannick

Hi! I'm Yannick Desiron, a motivated full stack developer in training with a unique background as a professional basketball player for 15 years. I played for top Belgian teams, winning multiple national titles and competing in the Champions League and FIBA Europe Cup.

My time as a professional athlete taught me discipline, perseverance, and how to perform under pressure—qualities I now bring to my software development work. Being part of team sports sharpened my communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively, which I value deeply in every project I work on.

Currently, I'm completing my programming studies and gaining hands-on experience through a full stack developer internship. I'm passionate about building clean, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications using technologies like React, Next.js, Angular, and .NET.

Fluent in Dutch and English and conversational in French, I enjoy working in international teams where I can continue to learn and grow. Outside of coding, basketball remains a big passion, and I also enjoy gaming and reading—activities that help me relax and recharge.

I'm excited to take the next step in my IT career and would love to connect — feel free to reach out!
